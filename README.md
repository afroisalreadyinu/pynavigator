pynavigator is an Emacs package that aims to do the following and not
much more:

- Identify the type of the identifier at point.

- Find the source files of identifiers, whether they are in a project,
  installed packages or in the standard library.

- Enable flexible configuration of how the sources files are displayed.

You can either drop this directoy in your `load-path` or install it
through melpa, when it is uploaded to melpa.
